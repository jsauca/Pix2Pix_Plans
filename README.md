# Pix2Pix with Plans
### Generation of Floorplans with GAN - Pix2Pix for Conversion in 3D models - PyTorch
## Requirements
Install requirements found in requirements.txt by running ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
## Dataset
After creation of floorplans with data transformer(RTV transformer-Katam pngs), use complete_floorplans/process.ipynb to concatenate channels, put your plans, energy loads and shapes under dataset/images/ following the same structure compatible with Torchvision data loader.
## Training of Pix2Pix
To train the Pix2pix run ```python3 train.py```
Change the options for training wanted in options/parse.py, e.g. batch size, condtional or not, learning rate, version of generator ...
The checkpoints for generator and discriminator, with samples generated are saved under temp/ . Import new checkpoints by modifying options and placing them under pix2pix/checkpoints. 
## Prediction of Energy load from files 
In energy_from_txt/ can be found two methods to extract and predict heating and cooling load for all files. To extract architecture parameters, train a Random Forest Regressor and predict new energy run ```text_extraction.ipynb``` 
To convert text files into heatmaps and train a CNN to predict new energy loads, run ```python3 txt_energy_amn.py``` and ```python3 test.py``` to generate new heating and cooling. Change parameters accordingly.
## Processing with RTV (SEG + IP)
Run ```python3 eval.py``` to evaluate RTV(Segmentation Network + IP-fusion) on inputs placed manually in rtv_inputs, outputs are saved in rtv_outputs. It allows for tuning of IP hyperparameters. Under IP_masks/ can be found IP_heatmaps which allow processing of heatmaps with IP and view of current heatmaps, and RTV_heatmaps which shows result of Data transformer from RTV paper. 
## Generation
When the training is complete and IP parameters tuned, one can generate new floorplans based on shapes of floorplans and energy put in inputs/shapes and defined in inputs/gen_val.txt respectively, or number of wanted free generations by specifying a number if not conditional. Run ```python3 generate_nrj.py``` Use latest checkpoint of generator to generate. 
## Conversion to 3D models 
The resulting outputs are saved under outputs/, with the samples before processing of RTV and after processing under outputs/rtv/ . The txt files can be found to reconstruct new 3D floorplan models in Revit.
